# SmartPass

- In LNMIIT we always carry our Institute ID with us thus if we need to board a college bus from the main gate we have to show our bus pass and well as our college ID.
- We can make our bus pass redundant if we can make smart use of our college ID.
- In this project, I intend to build an RFID Powered Smart Pass Access Control System using Raspberry Pi microprocessor.
- We have already seen this kind of services implemented in big hospitals or companies and even in different colleges across the world, e.g, in National Ilan University, we might have seen how they used RFID based locks to restrict access to certain areas.
- The same system can be used in other systems like RFID based door lock or RFID based access management system and even in Smart Card payments.
